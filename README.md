# GUI-for-OAI
This Python GUI manages 5G simulation components: start/stop gNB and UE with RF simulator, Docker container control, configuration file, and GitLab access.
# 5G Environment GUI

This repository contains a graphical user interface (GUI) developed in Python for controlling and managing various components of a 5G environment.

## Features

- **Start the gNB and UE with RF simulator:** Start the gNB (base station) and UE (user equipment) components of the 5G simulation environment with RF simulator support.
- **Start/Stop Docker containers:** Start and stop Docker containers for additional components of the simulation environment.
- **Additional options:** Access additional options, including opening relevant documentation on GitLab and access to the configuration file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Docker (if using Docker containers)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the `mourad.py` file to launch the GUI.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the simulation environment.
